## LIFE Topics

Aside from tech and business, I still highly enjoy writing about other topics. 

At the end of the day, life isn't just about money, it's also about exploration, art, travel, love, and philosophy.

*"Those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music." - Nietzsche*
